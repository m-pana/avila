# A digital approach to palaeography
An extensive analysis of the [Avila dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Avila). The goal is to identify which scribe is the author of a certain pattern based on the available attributes.

Algorithms employed include:
- QDA
- SVM
- Logistic Regression
- Ridge classifier
- k-NN
- Random forest

and others.

To shorten computation times and to ease the illustration of the behavior of certain algorithms, the study is restricted to the patterns associated to 6 out of the 12 scribes.
